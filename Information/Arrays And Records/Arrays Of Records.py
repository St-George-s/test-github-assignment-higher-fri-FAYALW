#An array of records is similar to a 1-D array, but instead of storing basic data types like strings or integers, it stores records.
#Each element of the array is a record that can be accessed using an index.
#In SQA Reference Language (Pseudocode)
#DECLARE allPlayers AS array of player INITIALLY [NULL] * 10000
	
#For instance, in Python, (when asked in the exam) you can create an array of Player records:
	# To add 1000 empty records:
	#allPlayers = []
	#for x in range(10000):
	    #allPlayers.append(Player())
