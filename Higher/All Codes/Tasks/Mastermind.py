## Generate a random four-digit number
## Ask the user to guess a number
## Add 1 to guess count
## Check if input matches exactly generated number, and if it does, output: Congratulations + guess count
## If the numbers arenâ€™t an exact match, check how many numbers are the same
## Output how many numbers are the same
