#Consider an array classHeights which stores the heights of students in a class: classHeights = [180, 163, 170, 190]
#Similarly, an array names might store names of teachers: names = ["Mr Walker", "Mr Smith", "Mrs Green"]
#To access an element from an array, you use the array's name followed by the index number in brackets.
#Remember that in most programming languages, array indexes start at 0.
#For example, accessing elements in the names array:
#print(names[0])  # Outputs: Mr Walker
#print(names[1])  # Outputs: Mr Smith
#print(names[2])  # Outputs: Mrs Green
#print(names[3])  # Error, as there is no element at index 3
