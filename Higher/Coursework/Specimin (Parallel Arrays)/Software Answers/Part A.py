#Value of the maximum number of jumps
# Starts at 100.
# Watchpoint is triggered at index 2 when the 
# value is 102 because 102 is larger than 100.
# Watchpoint is also triggered at index 3 when the 
# value is 108 because 108 is larger than 102.

#1e)
# The program is fit for its purpose as it generates a bib
# value for every athlete as required and specified.

#The code is maintainable as it is modular because there is
#a function for every functional requirement. This means it
#is modular because each module can be edited and tested
#independently.
